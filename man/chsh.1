.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBchsh\fR changes the user login shell\&. This determines the name of the user's initial login command\&. A normal user may only change the login shell for her own account, the super user may change the login shell for any account\&.

.PP
The only restrictions placed on the login shell is that the command name must be listed in \fI/etc/shells\fR, unless the invoker is the super\-user, and then any value may be added\&. An account with a restricted login shell may not change her login shell\&. For this reason, placing \fI/bin/rsh\fR in \fI/etc/shells\fR is discouraged since accidentally changing to a restricted shell would prevent the user from every changing her login shell back to its original value\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
If the \fB\-s\fR option is not selected, \fBchsh\fR operates in an interactive fashion, prompting the user with the current login shell\&. Enter the new value to change the shell, or leave the line blank to use the current one\&. The current shell is displayed between a pair of \fI[ ]\fR marks\&.
