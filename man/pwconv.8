.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBpwconv\fR creates \fIshadow\fR from \fIpasswd\fR and an optionally existing \fIshadow\fR\&.

.PP
\fBpwunconv\fR creates \fIpasswd\fR from \fIpasswd\fR and \fIshadow\fR and then removes \fIshadow\fR\&.

.PP
\fBgrpconv\fR creates \fIgshadow\fR from \fIgroup\fR and an optionally existing \fIgshadow\fR\&.

.PP
\fBgrpunconv\fR creates \fIgroup\fR from \fIgroup\fR and \fIgshadow\fR and then removes \fIgshadow\fR\&.

.PP
These four programs all operate on the normal and shadow password and group files: \fI/etc/passwd\fR, \fI/etc/group\fR, \fI/etc/shadow\fR, and \fI/etc/gshadow\fR\&.

.PP
Each program acquires the necessary locks before conversion\&. \fBpwconv\fR and \fBgrpconv\fR are similar\&. First, entries in the shadowed file which don't exist in the main file are removed\&. Then, shadowed entries which don't have `x' as the password in the main file are updated\&. Any missing shadowed entries are added\&. Finally, passwords in the main file are replaced with `x'\&. These programs can be used for initial conversion as well to update the shadowed file if the main file is edited by hand\&.

.PP
\fBpwconv\fR will use the values of \fIPASS_MIN_DAYS\fR, \fIPASS_MAX_DAYS\fR, and \fIPASS_WARN_AGE\fR from \fI/etc/login\&.defs\fR when adding new entries to \fI/etc/shadow\fR\&.

.PP
Likewise \fBpwunconv\fR and \fBgrpunconv\fR are similar\&. Passwords in the main file are updated from the shadowed file\&. Entries which exist in the main file but not in the shadowed file are left alone\&. Finally, the shadowed file is removed\&. Some password aging information is lost by \fBpwunconv\fR\&. It will convert what it can\&.

.SH "BUGS"

.PP
Errors in the password or group files (such as invalid or duplicate entries) may cause these programs to loop forever or fail in other strange ways\&. Please run \fBpwck\fR and \fBgrpck\fR to correct any such errors before converting to or from shadow passwords or groups\&.
