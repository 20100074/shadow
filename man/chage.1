.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBchage\fR command changes the number of days between passwordchanges and the date of the last password change\&. This information is used by the system to determine when a user must change her password\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
The options which apply to the \fBchage\fR command are:

.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-lastday\fR \fILAST_DAY\fR
Set the number of days since January 1st, 1970 when the password was last changed\&. The date may also be expressed in the format YYYY\-MM\-DD (or the format more commonly used in your area)\&.

.TP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-expiredate\fR \fIEXPIRE_DATE\fR
Set the date on which the user's account will no longer be accessible\&. The \fIEXPIRE_DATE\fR option is the number of days since January 1, 1970 on which the accounted is locked\&. The date may also be expressed in the format YYYY\-MM\-DD (or the format more commonly used in your area)\&. A user whose account is locked must contact the system administrator before being able to use the system again\&. Passing the number \fI\-1\fR as the \fIEXPIRE_DATE\fR will remove an accounts expiration date\&.

.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-inactive\fR \fIINACTIVE\fR
Set the number of days of inactivity after a password has expired before the account is locked\&. The \fIINACTIVE\fR option is the number of days of inactivity\&. A value of 0 disables this feature\&. A user whose account is locked must contact the system administrator before being able to use the system again\&.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
Show account aging information\&.

.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-mindays\fR \fIMIN_DAYS\fR
Set the minimum number of days between password changes\&. A value of zero for this field indicates that the user may change her password at any time\&.

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-maxdays\fR \fIMAX_DAYS\fR
Set maximum number of days during which a password is valid\&. When \fIMAX_DAYS\fR plus \fILAST_DAY\fR is less than the current day, the user will be required to change her password before being able to use her account\&. This occurrence can be planned for in advance by use of the \fB\-W\fR option, which provides the user with advance warning\&.

.TP
\fB\-W\fR, \fBwarndays\fR \fIWARN_DAYS\fR
Set the number of days of warning before a password change is required\&. The \fIWARN_DAYS\fR option is the number of days prior to the password expiring that a user will be warned her password is about to expire\&.

.PP
If none of the options are selected, \fBchage\fR operates in an interactive fashion, prompting the user with the current values for all of the fields\&. Enter the new value to change the field, or leave the line blank to use the current value\&. The current value is displayed between a pair of \fI[ ]\fR marks\&.

.SH "NOTE"

.PP
The \fBchage\fR program requires shadow password file to be available\&. Its functionality is not available when passwords are stored in the passwd file\&.

.PP
The \fBchage\fR command is restricted to the root user, except for the \fB\-l\fR option, which may be used by an unprivileged user to determine when her password or account is due to expire\&.
