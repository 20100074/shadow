The password field may not be filled if shadow passwords have been enabled. If shadow passwords are being used, the encrypted password will be found in 
\fI/etc/shadow\fR. The encrypted password consists of characters from the 64 characters alphabet a thru z, A thru Z, 0 thru 9, \\. and /. Optionally it can start with a "$" character. This means the encrypted password was generated using another (not DES) algorithm. For example if it starts with "$1$" it means the MD5\-based algorithm was used. Refer to 
\fBcrypt\fR(3) 
for details on how this string is interpreted.
