.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBvipw\fR 
and 
\fBvigr\fR 
will edit the files 
\fI/etc/passwd\fR 
and 
\fI/etc/group\fR, respectively. With the 
\fB\-s\fR 
flag, they will edit the shadow versions of those files, 
\fI/etc/shadow\fR 
and 
\fI/etc/gshadow\fR, respectively. The programs will set the appropriate locks to prevent file corruption. When looking for an editor, the programs will first try the environment variable 
\fB$VISUAL\fR, then the environment variable 
\fI$EDITOR\fR, and finally the default editor, 
\fBvi\fR(1).
