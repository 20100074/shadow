    <para>
      <command>logoutd</command> enforces the login time and port
      restrictions specified in
      <filename>/etc/porttime</filename>. <command>logoutd</command>
      should be started from <filename>/etc/rc</filename>.
      The <filename>/var/run/utmp</filename> file is scanned periodically
      and each user name
      is checked to see if the named user is permitted on the named port
      at the current time.
      Any login session which is violating the restrictions in <filename>
        /etc/porttime
      </filename>
      is terminated.
