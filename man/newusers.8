.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBnewusers\fR reads a file of user name and clear\-text password pairs and uses this information to update a group of existing users or to create new users\&. Each line is in the same format as the standard password file (see \fBpasswd\fR(5)) with the following exceptions:

.TP
\fIpw_passwd\fR
This field will be encrypted and used as the new value of the encrypted password\&.

.TP
\fIpw_age\fR
This field will be ignored for shadow passwords if the user already exists\&.

.TP
\fIpw_gid\fR
This field may be the name of an existing group, in which case the named user will be added as a member\&. If a non\-existent numerical group is given, a new group will be created having this number\&.

.TP
\fIpw_dir\fR
This field will be checked for existence as a directory and a new directory with the same name will be created if it does not already exist\&. The ownership of the directory will be set to be that of the user being created or updated\&.

.PP
This command is intended to be used in a large system environment where many accounts are updated at a single time\&.

.SH "CAVEATS"

.PP
The input file must be protected since it contains unencrypted passwords\&.
