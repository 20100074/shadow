.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgpasswd\fR is used to administer the \fI/etc/group\fR file (and
\fI/etc/gshadow\fR file if compiled with SHADOWGRP defined). Every group can
have administrators, members and a password. System administrator can use
\fB\-A\fR option to define group administrator(s) and \fB\-M\fR option to
define members and has all rights of group administrators and members.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Group administrator can add and delete users using \fB\-a\fR and \fB\-d\fR
options respectively. Administrators can use \fB\-r\fR option to remove group
password. When no password is set only group members can use \fBnewgrp\fR to
join the group. Option \fB\-R\fR disables access via a password to the group
through \fBnewgrp\fR command (however members will still be able to switch to
this group).
.PP
\fBgpasswd\fR called by a group administrator with group name only prompts
for the group password. If password is set the members can still
\fBnewgrp\fR(1) without a password, non\-members must supply the password.
